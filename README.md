Youtube to S3 downloader

I had to download some quite big youtube videos and while downloading youtube  used to peg down transfer speed because of limited bandwidth from ISP. 
So i had to do it from AWS.. where i would run my code in a container and dowload it to a S3.
It has two version one in python and one in node.
